# crystal-docs-web

Code for the [crystal-docs.org](https://crystal-docs.org) website.

Requires [crystal-lang](https://crystal-lang.org) 0.18.7+

You will need to create a GitHub developer application in order to test user interaction.

When starting the application you will need to provide the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `CRYSTALDOCS_BASE_URL` which is used to generate the `redirect_uri` for the OAuth flow, making it easier to test locally.

Build with `crystal build --release src/crystal-docs-web.cr`.
